# Recursive-Descent-Compiler

This Project is a Recursive Descent compiler that combines Lexical, Syntactic and Semantic Analyzers for simple programming language.

In order for us to use Recursive Descent method, a number of preparations for the original language were required:

- Left factoring

- Left recursion

- Nullable, First & Follow Table

The compiler was written in C programming language with an Visual Studio environment.
